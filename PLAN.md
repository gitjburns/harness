# Implementation Plan

Working log. Behavior contract: `SPEC.md`.

## Done

1. **Terminal layer spike.** Raw transcript in scrollback plus an app-managed bottom input region; resize via the parked hidden cursor; bracketed paste. Scrollback and cursor parts superseded by 15.
2. **Chat app.** `config.toml` and `.env`, session files with atomic writes, SSE streaming client, `/exit` and `/quit`, Esc to stop, `--resume <PATH>`.
3. **Review fixes.** Status line erased at screen bottom; partial reply lost on error paths; raw mode left on failed startup; stale pending-line row after scroll; per-delta cursor-query lag (deltas coalesced, input poll 20 ms); resize ordering (`biased` select); temp file fsync. Scrollback-specific fixes superseded by 15.
4. **Flicker fix.** Synchronized updates per frame.
5. **Reasoning.** Streamed as `delta.reasoning`, displayed dim, saved as `reasoning`, sent back.
6. **Input prompt.** Bright white `> ` in the input box.
7. **Context tokens.** `stream_options.include_usage`; status line shows `total_tokens`.
8. **Tool calling.** Single `REPL` tool; per-turn local Python driver (`src/repl_driver.py`) with `replib/` registry and `help()`; `approval_mode` allow/ask/auto (Shift+Tab, persisted via `toml_edit`); LLM classifier for `auto`; `output_limit` (default 100 KB).
9. **Tool-calling hardening (review).** Results recorded before terminal I/O; driver `setsid()` (no controlling tty); request-reader thread; driver survives closed stdout; config save keeps decor, handles inline tables, atomic; `finish_reason: "length"` drops cut-off calls; SIGHUP/SIGTERM/SIGINT cleanup; resume answers unanswered calls; `.env` read privately.
10. **Situational awareness.** Each turn opens with synthetic `FYI()` and `help()` REPL calls, run in the REPL like any other (honesty rule: synthetic calls must work when made explicitly). `FYI()` is implemented only in the driver: date, latest `prompt_tokens` (sent with every code request), model.
11. **Approval exemption.** Code made only of `FYI()` and `help()` statements never needs approval. The governing contract in `SPEC.md` covers all present and future synthetic tool calls, whether app-generated or explicitly called by the model, in every approval mode and permission level. `reasoning()` is separately exempt and is not synthetic. Neither exemption covers unrelated code bundled with the calls, including code evaluated in arguments.
12. **Instant resume replay.** The session replays as one batched write, so it appears at once instead of visibly scrolling. Superseded by 15.
13. **Synthetic-call cleanup.** Each turn removes all earlier `FYI()`/`help()`-only calls (and results, and emptied assistant messages) from the session before adding its own, so exactly one of each is in context. First case of the app removing messages.
14. **Chat system message.** Optional `[chat] prompt`, prepended to each chat request at send time and never saved, so the current config applies to resumed sessions.
15. **App-managed scrollback.** Alternate screen with mouse capture; the transcript is drawn each frame from the system message, messages, the turn in progress, and display-only notes, so it always matches the model's context. App word wrap, scrolling (follow at bottom, PageUp/PageDown, wheel), drag selection with OSC 52 copy on release.
16. **Endpoint-neutral replies.** Each streamed `delta` is merged whole by the OpenAI SDK's `accumulate_delta` rule, and every field is saved and sent back unchanged, so any endpoint's reasoning format (`reasoning`, `reasoning_content`, `reasoning_details`) round-trips. Only display picks known reasoning fields.
17. **Tool reasoning (experimental).** `[chat] tool_reasoning` / `/tool-reasoning`: earlier turns' reasoning is sent and drawn as generated reasoning-history entries containing `reasoning("…")` calls with `(no output)` results, built per request from the unchanged session. First library function, `replib/reasoning.py`: a no-op the model is meant to call, listed by `help()`, separately exempt from approval when called alone on a plain string literal; it is not a synthetic tool function.
18. **Command completion.** Typing `/` lists matching commands (name, description) below the input in place of the status line; Up/Down, Tab, Enter, Esc. One command table (`src/commands.rs`) drives both completion and running.
19. **Harness directory.** `config.toml`, `.env`, `sessions/`, and `replib/` live in `~/.harness`, so the app runs in any repo. Sessions are flat and named by file name: `/rename <name>` (first command with an argument), `--resume` lists names, `--resume <NAME>` resumes.

Decided against:
- Audit-hook gating as the first permission layer (classifier chosen instead).
- A driver → app callback for `FYI()` (Python must not call Rust).
- Saving the system message in the session (config edits wouldn't reach resumed sessions).

## Next

1. **Sandbox.** Replace the CPython REPL with Monty; permission levels, brokered commands, agent-written library functions, failure log. Design: `SPEC-sandbox.md`.
2. **AGENTS.md.** Optional `[chat] agents_file` (absolute path). A synthetic `REPL` call (id `agents-…`) reads the file and prints it as a JSON object; it lives in the first turn's synthetic assistant message, ahead of `FYI()`/`help()`. Every turn, before cleanup: run it; insert it after the first user message if missing; replace code and result if changed; remove it if the setting is removed. Result truncated at `output_limit` like any call.
3. **Context management.** Proactive pruning so compaction is never needed; replaces the interim `output_limit`.
4. **`replib/` functions.** File helpers (`read`/`write`/`edit`), subagents (as host functions), knowledge-base search.
5. **Final-turn tool reasoning** (to revisit): convert the turn in progress's reasoning too. Design: `SPEC-final-turn-tool-reasoning.md`.
6. **Harness as teacher.** Turn the failure log (`SPEC-sandbox.md`) into proposed edits to the persistent guidance, for user approval.

## Open

- Two instances started in the same second, in any repos, share a session file name and overwrite each other.
- Process-group kill uses `/bin/kill` to avoid a direct `libc` dependency.
- `serde_json` lacks `preserve_order`, so kept fields are saved and sent back with object keys sorted (values unchanged). Fix: enable the feature in `Cargo.toml`.

## Reference

- Run: `harness` (`target/debug/` on `PATH`) from the target repo, with `~/.harness` symlinked to this repo during development; `harness --resume [NAME]`.
- Python audit hooks (PEP 578) report `open`, `os.remove`/`rename`, `subprocess.Popen`, `os.system`, `socket.connect`, `ctypes.*`, and `import` events with real arguments; not a security boundary.
